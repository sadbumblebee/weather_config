## What is this?

It's a `JSON` feed that our home [MagicMirror2](https://magicmirror.builders/) reads. The feed provides daily "compliments" based on the type of weather forecast.

## Why open it up?

This is really just so my brothers and family members can make pull-requests to change the "compliments" as they see fit, and to add a little bit of them in our house.

## How do I do it?

You'll need a Github account. From there open the `dw_weather_config.json` and make your edits following proper `JSON` syntax and possible [currentweather](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/tree/master/modules/default/compliments) configurations.

* <code>day_sunny</code>
* <code>day_cloudy</code>
